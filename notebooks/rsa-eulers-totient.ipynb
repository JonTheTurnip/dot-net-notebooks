    "In number theory, Euler's totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In other words, it is the number of integers k in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n for which the greatest common divisor gcd(n, k) is equal to 1. The integers k of this form are sometimes referred to as totatives of n.\r\n",

    "[Euclid's gcd algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For example, the totatives of n = 9 are the six numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8. They are all relatively prime to 9, but the other three numbers in this range, 3, 6, and 9 are not, since gcd(9, 3) = gcd(9, 6) = 3 and gcd(9, 9) = 9. Therefore, φ(9) = 6. As another example, φ(1) = 1 since for n = 1 the only integer in the range from 1 to n is 1 itself, and gcd(1, 1) = 1.\r\n",

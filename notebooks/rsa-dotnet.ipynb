    "## The RSA algorithm is used for asymmetric key encryption.  It generates a public-private key pair and uses them for exchanging data\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This is different from the Diffie Hellman algorithm which generates a shared non public key that can then be used by both parties for subsequent data exchange using symmetric key encryption. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's say that Bob wants to send a message to Alice that no one else can read.  How can we achieve this?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "One way is to use the RSA **asymmetric** encryption method.  This method requires two keys, one that is private and one that is public.  In our example Alice will share the public key and Bob will use this key to encrypt the message that he wants to send to Alice.  Once the message has been encrypted the only way to decrypt it is to use the private key that only Alice has.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Note that in practice RSA is expensive to compute and therefore is mainly used to establish a session key which can then be used for less expensive symmetric encrytion /decryption of messages within the session.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The code below conceals all the interesting indepth math behind and just gets the job done.  \r\n",
